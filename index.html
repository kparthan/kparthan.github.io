        Hi! Welcome to my Web Page. 
        <br><br>

        I am a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://c3.ai" target="_blank">C3.ai</a> and am based in Sydney, 
        Australia. My expertise is in employing statistical machine learning techniques to solve challenging 
        business problems. My current focus is mainly in the implementation of predictive modelling solutions
        for clients in Financial Services and the Oil &amp; Gas industry. 
        <br><br>

        I was previously a Management Consultant with Deloitte Australia, where I worked 
        on implementing time series driven forecasting solutions for clients in the Transportation sector.
        I also implemented a 
        <a href="https://www.forgov.qld.gov.au/storm-tide-forecasting" target="_blank">Machine Learning PoC for predicting storm tides</a> 
        for the Queensland Department of Environment &amp; Science. 
        <br><br>

        I come from a deeply technical background supported by rigorous academic training 
        (<a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=paKdhzoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>).
      I was an OCE Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/AF" target="_blank">CSIRO</a> 
      in Brisbane, where I developed data science and machine learning
      methods to facilitate the analyses of Big Data in the Genomics space.
      <br><br>

      I completed my PhD in April 2016 in the 
      <a href="http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/about/schools/clayton/" class="style2" target="_blank">Clayton School of Information Technology</a> at
      <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/" class="style2" target="_blank">Monash University</a>. 
      My supervisors were <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~karun/Site/Home.html" class="style2" target="_blank">Arun Konagurthu</a> and <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/maria-garcia-de-la-banda" class="style2" target="_blank">Maria Garcia de la Banda</a>.<br><br> I commenced my doctoral
      study at Monash in February 2012. Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student
      at <a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in/" class="style2" target="_blank">Indian
      Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM)</a>. I graduated in July 2011 with
      Integrated Bachelor's &amp; Master's degrees in Computer Science and Engineering.
      <!-- with Chemistry as my minor subject. -->
      <br><br> 
      <!-- I hail from Visakhapatnam, a
      coastal city in the Southern state of Andhra Pradesh in India. I spent major
      part of my life in my hometown, then moved to Chennai to do my undergraduation,
      with a brief stint in NTU, Singapore as an exchange student. I have been living
      in Melbourne since February this year and it's been amazing so far.<br><br>-->

          I submitted my PhD thesis for examination in November 2015.
          I am currently looking for exciting positions in academia/industry 
          in statistics oriented roles, mainly in mathematical modelling,
	  quantitative analysis,
